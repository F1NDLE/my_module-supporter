### This module will give you proper device certification by installing a valid keybox, security patch, and bootloader spoof 

## How does this work?
Keybox - This is the identification key for every Android device. If you unlock the bootloader, root it, or customize it, this keybox will be permanently invalidated and can only be restored by returning it to Lock the bootloader and remove all modifications on the device. My Modulto is the one doing the faking.

### Advantages 
My module automatically installs a valid keybox, security patch, and bootloader list into the required ROOT memory branches (/data/adb/tricky_store)
List - keybox.xml, security patch.txt, target.txt.
Required modules - _Play integraty Fix/fork_, _Tricky Store_, Zygisk Next (magisk settings zygisk)



### yeah... а кто отменял русский?
